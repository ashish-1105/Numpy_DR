## Digit Recognition using numpy
This implementation to recognize digits of 28x28 pixels is inspired by Samson Zhang


### Problem Statement
To recognize/predict a 28x28 pixel image of digits

Dataset used for development/training involved a matrix of 42000 rows and 785 columns with first column as label and the remaining 784 columns as values of each pixel(28 x 28 = 784).


### Libraries used
!. pandas - to read the csv files of datasets
2. matplotlib - to plot/show the image of digits
3. numpy - for implementation of the mathematics lying behind
